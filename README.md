# DS_INTERNSHIP_PROJECT_1

Project 01: 

Data Cleaning, EDA, and KNN Model Training Dive into hands-on experience with messy datasets! This project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and training a KNN model, with performance evaluated through manual splitting and cross-validation. Check out our detailed findings and visualizations!

Project 01 

The goal of this project is to provide you with hands-on experience in handling 
messy datasets. You will clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis 
(EDA), detect and remove outliers, manually split the data, and train a K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. Finally, you will evaluate the model using both 
manual splitting and cross-validation and compare the results  and write 
summary in word file with proper results screenshots.

Project Steps 

Data Cleaning

• Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. 
• Identify and handle missing values: 

o Use appropriate strategies such as mean/median imputation or 
forward/backward fill. 

o Document your chosen strategies. 
• Correct data types and standardize formats. 
• Address any inconsistent or erroneous data entries. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
• Perform EDA to understand the dataset 

o Generate descriptive statistics. 
o Create visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, box plots, and 
correlation matrices. 

• Document your findings and key patterns. 
Outlier Detection and Removal 
Data Science  Project-1 
• Detect outliers using methods such as Z-score, IQR, or visualization 
techniques. 
• Develop a function to handle outliers appropriately (e.g., removing or 
capping them). 
• Document your approach and its impact on the dataset. 
Manual Data Splitting 
• Manually split the cleaned dataset into training and testing sets (like 80/20 
split). 
Model Training 
• Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on the training set using manual 
splitting. 
• Implement cross-validation to train model again and assess the performance 
of the KNN model. 
Model Evaluation 
• Evaluate the KNN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 
F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 
• Compare the results from the manual split with those from cross-validation. 
• Create visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves to illustrate 
model performance.
